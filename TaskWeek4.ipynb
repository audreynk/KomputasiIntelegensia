        "Dalam eksperimen pelatihan AlexNet dan LeNet, peningkatan jumlah epoch untuk AlexNet secara signifikan mempengaruhi kinerjanya dibandingkan dengan LeNet. Dengan lebih banyak epoch pelatihan, AlexNet biasanya menunjukkan peningkatan akurasi dan ketahanan dalam mengklasifikasikan pola yang kompleks karena arsitekturnya yang lebih dalam dan jumlah parameter yang lebih besar, yang memungkinkannya untuk mempelajari fitur-fitur yang lebih rumit dari dataset. Di sisi lain, meskipun LeNet mungkin menunjukkan sedikit peningkatan dengan bertambahnya epoch, arsitektur yang lebih sederhana membatasi kemampuannya untuk menangkap tingkat detail yang sama seperti AlexNet. Akibatnya, AlexNet lebih efektif untuk dataset yang lebih besar dan tugas yang lebih menantang, sehingga menghasilkan kinerja yang lebih baik seiring dengan peningkatan jumlah epoch pelatihan. Perilaku ini dapat dijelaskan oleh kemampuan jaringan yang lebih dalam untuk memanfaatkan data dengan lebih efektif, sehingga meningkatkan kemampuan generalisasi sambil meminimalkan risiko overfitting."

Ketika ukuran batch ditingkatkan, throughput biasanya meningkat karena pemrosesan paralel yang lebih efisien, memungkinkan model untuk memproses lebih banyak gambar dalam satu waktu. Namun, ukuran batch yang terlalu besar dapat menyebabkan penggunaan memori GPU yang lebih tinggi, berpotensi menyebabkan out-of-memory error, terutama pada arsitektur jaringan yang lebih dalam seperti AlexNet. Sebaliknya, mengurangi ukuran batch dapat menurunkan throughput tetapi mungkin meningkatkan akurasi, terutama jika ukuran batch yang kecil memungkinkan model untuk belajar dari variasi data yang lebih baik dan mengurangi risiko overfitting. Pengaruh ukuran batch juga tergantung pada arsitektur model dan karakteristik dataset yang digunakan; oleh karena itu, eksperimen lebih lanjut diperlukan untuk menemukan ukuran batch yang optimal yang seimbang antara throughput dan akurasi sambil mempertimbangkan keterbatasan memori GPU."

Try modifying the network architecture and resolution conversion, e.g., to 56 or to 84 dimensions for its input instead. Can you do so without reducing the accuracy of the network? Consult the VGG paper (Simonyan and Zisserman, 2014) for ideas on adding more nonlinearities prior to downsampling.**"

        "Reason:\n",
        "Batch normalization (BN) subtracts the mean and divides by the standard deviation of the inputs, which effectively normalizes the input activations. Since the bias term (learned offset) in the layer is nullified by this normalization, the bias becomes redundant and can be safely removed. This reduces the number of parameters and speeds up training without impacting the model's performance.\n",

Dengan mengurangi jumlah parameter dalam model, sparsifikasi dapat membantu mencegah overfitting dan meningkatkan generalisasi model. Sparsifikasi memaksa model untuk mempelajari representasi yang lebih efisien dan relevan, karena hanya fitur-fitur penting yang dipertahankan. Hal ini dapat meningkatkan kinerja pada data yang tidak terlihat."

Proyeksi ke kerucut konveks dapat membantu dalam memodelkan masalah optimasi dengan batasan tertentu, sedangkan transformasi grup simetri dapat digunakan untuk menjaga struktur invariansi pada data. Penggunaan proyeksi ini tergantung pada konteks masalah yang sedang dihadapi dan dapat membantu meningkatkan kinerja model dengan memanfaatkan struktur khusus dari data."
